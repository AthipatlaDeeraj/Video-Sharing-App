//now usually what ever you want to download through npm you keep it inside package.json then you use npm install so that all at once installs

-> now my website frontend is communicating with backend using http calls purely and using react 
BUT HOW ??

-> Also every time it is authorizing everytime you try to modify something like put/post/delete so using verifyToken.js it checks 
BUT HOW DOES IT STORE HOW IT COMMUNICATES OR GET ACCESSS EVERYTIME
->I think it is storing the uid,name Also 3 parameters it stores in order to check again and again not just using npm module is answer

***FOR GOOGLE AUTH***
-> Now in google auth google when authenticated is going to create cookies-tokens and gives it to backend 
(Google returns an ID token (JWT))
SO BACKEND SHOULD TAKE THAT INFO LIKE Verify token with Googleâ€™s public keys, Extract user info (name, email, picture).

Issue your own session token (JWT or cookie).

Send that token to frontend.

Save it in : HttpOnly cookie

***So using firebase i got all the user google data whatever is there see using console.log(result)***
